# RISC-V MYTH_program
The **RISC-V MYTH**  program by  is a structured, hands-on course designed to teach students and engineers the fundamentals of RISC-V processor design using **TL-Verilog**. It covers the **RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA), microarchitecture,** and the step-by-step process of building a **5-stage pipelined RISC-V CPU**. The program utilizes **Makerchip IDE**, an open-source platform for TL-Verilog coding and simulation, allowing participants to design, verify, and simulate their processors in a cloud-based environment. Throughout the course, we can explore key concepts such as hazards, forwarding, bypassing, and pipeline design techniques, ensuring a strong grasp of modern processor design principles.
## Course Outline

### Day 2: [Introduction to ABI and Basic Verification Flow](day2.md)
### Day 3: [Digital Logic with TL-Verilog and Makerchip IDE](day3.md)
### Day 4: [Basic RISC-V CPU Microarchitecture](day4.md)
### Day 5: [Complete Pipelined RISC-V Microarchitecture](day5.md)

## Acknowledgements
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to **VSD (VLSI System Design)** and **RISC-V International** for organizing the **RISC-V MYTH program**. Special thanks to **Kunal Ghosh** and the VSD team for their exceptional guidance and for providing valuable learning resources on **RISC-V ISA** and microarchitecture.


Additionally, I appreciate the open-source tools and platforms, such as **Makerchip IDE** and **TL-Verilog**, which enabled hands-on experience in designing a **RISC-V core**.


This repository is a reflection of my learning journey through the RISC-V MYTH program, and I acknowledge all contributors and communities that have supported open-source VLSI and RISC-V education
