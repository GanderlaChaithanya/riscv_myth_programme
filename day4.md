# Simple RISCV Micro-architecture

In the RISC V processor, the term RISC stands for “reduced instruction set computer” which executes few computer instructions whereas ‘V’ stands for the 5th generation. It is an open-source hardware ISA (instruction set architecture) based on the established principle of RISC.

## RISC V Architecture & Working
The RV12 RISC V architecture is shown below. The RV12 is highly configurable with a single-core RV32I and RV64I compliant RISC CPU which is used in embedded fields. The RV12 is also from a 32 or 64-bit CPU family depending on the industrial standard RISC-V instruction set.
The RV12 simply executes a Harvard architecture for simultaneous access to instruction as well as data memory.
